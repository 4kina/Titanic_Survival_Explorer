# Titanic_Survival_Explorer
My project for the Developing Data Products course on Coursera

This application is a project for the [Developing Data Products Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products/). The goal of the course is to learn how to create and deploy Shiny application. The analyzed data is my choice. 

The application is created as the initial analysis of the Titanic data provided by Kaggle competition. The user input data for this application is the preprocessed train dataset with the constructed features. The Random Forest algorithm uses the input features to calculate the classification accuracy of the passenger survival and to build the relative importance of selected variables. Here you can try this app:
